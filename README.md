# llvm_patch_maintenance

Utility scripts to keep an llvm fork with patches up to date.

The entry point here is `update_patches.sh`.

These scripts have hardcoded paths and other assumptions that are true on the system
where I use them but probably not true anywhere else. They would probably need some work
before they work elsewhere, which is left as an exercise for the reader.
